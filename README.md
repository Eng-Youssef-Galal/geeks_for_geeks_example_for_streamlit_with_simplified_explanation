## This Python code is a Streamlit app that analyzes accident data in the United Kingdom from 2012-2014. Here's a breakdown of what each section of the code does:

1.Importing the required modules: The code imports the necessary modules, including Streamlit, Pandas, NumPy, Pydeck, and Plotly Express.

2.Defining the data URL: The code defines the URL for the dataset that needs to be imported.

3.Defining the load_data function: This is a function that loads the data from the CSV file and parses the date and time columns as date and time. It also drops rows with missing values in the latitude and longitude columns. The function then renames some columns and returns the cleaned data.

4.Loading the data: The code loads the first 10,000 rows of the data using the load_data function.

5.Plotting the map of accident locations: The code plots a Streamlit map that shows the locations of accidents in the United Kingdom where the number of casualties is greater than or equal to the number specified by the user using the slider.

6.Plotting the 3D map of the number of accidents that happen between an hour interval: The code plots a Pydeck 3D map that shows the number of accidents that occurred during a given time of the day. The user can select the hour to look at using a slider.

7.Plotting the histogram for the minute of the hour at which accidents happen: The code plots a histogram that shows the breakdown of accidents by minute between the selected hour and the next hour.

8.Showing the condition of the road at the time of accidents: The code uses a checkbox to show the raw data for the weather conditions, light conditions, speed limit, and the number of casualties for the selected road surface condition.

9.Showing the raw data: If the user selects the "Show Raw Data" checkbox, the code shows the raw data for the selected condition of the road at the time of accidents.
